# Group Execution State (Authoritative) — playerhoods.com

Last updated: 2026-01-24

This file is the single source of truth for the current Group governance / contract / migration state.
All future Group-related slices must read and comply with this file BEFORE generating any SQL / RLS / service / UI changes.

---

## 0. Design Principles (Binding for Future Slices)

### 0.1 People-first UI
- All user-facing flows MUST be person-centric.
- Users select people, not groups.
- Groups are governance/reference structures and MUST NOT be required as a primary selection unit.

### 0.2 Club Entry Posture (Non-contractual)
The system MAY support club-level entry experiences as a product/onboarding strategy.

This posture:
- Describes how users initially enter and discover people.
- Does NOT introduce any contract-level objects, enums, or schema guarantees.
- Does NOT alter GroupContract_v1 definitions or semantics.

Constraints:
- Club entry posture MUST NOT be relied upon by other contract-level components.
- No downstream system may assume the existence of a “club entry group”
  unless a future GroupContract_v2 explicitly defines it.

### 0.3 Non-user Participation (Cold Start)
- The system MUST support inviting non-users (email-based) into matches.
- Non-user participation is match-scoped and MUST NOT require group membership.
- Notification MAY be handled via email.

### 0.4 Conditional Provenance
- Provenance is recorded ONLY when the system enforces a participation boundary.
- For open / guest / link-based participation, provenance SHOULD be NULL.
- Provenance is not a permission subject and not a UI concept.

## 1. Frozen documents (must comply)

- docs/constitution/Group Constitution.md
- docs/specs/GroupContract_v1.md
- docs/governance/Group Governance – Technical Appendix.md
- docs/playerhoods/supabase/migrations/Governance Migration Template.sql

If any slice output conflicts with the above documents, the documents win.

---

## 2. Non-negotiable rules

### 2.1 Enum & semantics
- No new enum values and no reinterpretation of existing enum values without GroupContract_v2.

### 2.2 Contract-level views
- NO table.* usage in contract-level views.
- Explicit column lists are required.
- public.group_details column order is locked for Contract v1 (positions 1–18).
- Any future fields must append after position 18 only.

### 2.3 Governance / Contract DB changes
- Append-only migrations.
- RLS tightening via policy replacement only.

## 3. Migration inventory (repository listing)

003_auto_create_profile.sql
004_fix_rls_policies.sql
005_add_duration.sql
006_backfill_user_settings.sql
007_create_groups.sql
008_group_creation_semantics.sql
009_group_details_view_alignment.sql
010_invite_flow_rls.sql
011_accept_flow_rls.sql
012_removal_exit_rls.sql

---

## 4. Applied migrations (facts only)

007–012 applied and confirmed.
See previous execution records for detailed semantics.

---

## 5. Contract Upgrade Triggers (Reminder)

The following conditions SHALL trigger a mandatory review
for upgrading GroupContract_v1 to GroupContract_v2:

1. Introducing a new contract-level group classification
   (e.g. formalizing “club entry group” as a guaranteed type).
2. Adding or reinterpreting enum values related to group_type, join_policy, or visibility.
3. Changing semantics or column order of public.group_details (positions 1–18).
4. Requiring downstream systems to rely on club-level grouping
   as a stable governance or permission boundary.

If any slice meets one or more conditions:
- GroupContract_v1 MUST remain unchanged.
- GroupContract_v2 MUST be drafted before implementation.
